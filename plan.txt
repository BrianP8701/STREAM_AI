Problem 1: How the fuck do I align the gcode and the video?????




1. Write algorithm to locate tip as parsing through g-code
    a. I now have the FPS, pixel to mm ratio. Now it is time to parse through gcode and locate tip accordingly
    b. Essentially, read through the gcode and create a list 
2. Crop relevant part of image
3. Edge extraction appropriately
4. Get the actual answers for different frames
5. Create python test file

????


Input:
.mov
.gcode

output
JSON file

In the future, we will be recieving frames one by one in real time.
From that we will have to output most recently extruded volume details
